### SplainTime

I needed a dead simple time tracking app. By 'dead simple' I don't mean some predictive mapping of my favored clients and a process listener that knows which programs were in focus at any given time. I mean the simplest I can get away with: SplainTime is a text entry box that outputs a timestamp and a time difference in a text file with the date on it. It also has a button to open the text file.

[put a picture here]

Almost feature complete. The only things I still want are flushing the buffer when the window closes, check the file for a previous time, and a {} flag for unrelated distractions.

### Run

    java SplainTime

Or build an executable jar and double click on that.

### License

Though I like the spirit of WTFPL, SplainTime is released as [Fair License](http://fairlicense.org/) So,
