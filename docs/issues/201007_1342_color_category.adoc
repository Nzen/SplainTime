== Color recognized category

* status : to do
* priority : low

Splaintime should color something (min?) when it recognizes a category. That way, I don't need to ask ??cat before entering it.

perhaps color something, based on whether it's currently a category. That way, I don't need to ask or hope. Hold the categories in memory, but consider refreshing hourly or whenever asked.
