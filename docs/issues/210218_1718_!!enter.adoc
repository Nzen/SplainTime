== Ease harvesting tags for !!enter

* assignee : Nicholas
* status : deciding merit
* priority : low

I sometimes work at a different computer. To enter times later, I record them out of band in the proper format to use with the !!enter dialog. It would be nice if splaintime offered some means of retrieving tags in a format that I could paste to another splaintime's !!enter.

This is, of course, a workaround for the lava layer between the text output and the db values, which I am pretty sure I sync between instances, when requested.
