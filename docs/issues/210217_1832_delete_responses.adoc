Splaintime replies with text in response to queries or invalid input (ex ??ts banana >> 30m). Select this text so removing it is a single keypress.

if person says -0 or -6:51 when the time is 6:51, then remove the operand from the text. That way, there's some feedback, without getting in so and so's way. It's not as 'hey there's a problem here in your intention' as a dialog that says 'commit anyway?', but I'm the only user, so I can withstand that.

ditch the y/n responses when asking ??cat. Just the presence of the wrapper is enough.
