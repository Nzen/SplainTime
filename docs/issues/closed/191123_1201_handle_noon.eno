title : Handle noon

status : closed

priority : Highest

-- desc
Splaintime doesn't handle adjusting times at noon nor midnight.

Steps:
	- (Precondition) Time is 12:05 pm
	- Enter "-12:01" as the adjustment, with some text

Expected : Duration label shows "4 min"

Saw : Duration label shows "-1447 min"

Underlying cause:
	| SplainTime.adjustToHhmmFormat() tries to find a time within the last
	| twelve hours to be that time. Twelve doesn't always fit the way
	| this is implemented.

I've provided some tests for the possibilities I'm aware of.
I'd like to say it's exhaustive, but it may not be.

I'm satisfied that adjusting the time works across noon.
